gatein-portal-extension: Portal Extension
============================
Author: Thomas Heute, Peter Palaga  
Level: Beginner  
Technologies: JBoss Portal Platform, Portal Extension  
Summary: Portal Extension  
Target Product: JBoss Portal Platform 6.1  
Source: <https://github.com/gatein/gatein-portal-quickstart>


What is it?
-----------

This project demonstrates a simple Portal Extension. It shows how it is possible to extend and customize a portal without
modifying the files included in gatein.ear. The main advantage of this approach to customization is that upgrades to new
versions of JBoss Portal Platform will be easier to handle as all the customization can be embedded in separate
deployable packages.

Portal Extension customizes the default portal available at [http://localhost:8080/portal](http://localhost:8080/portal) by doing few changes:

* Replace the front page image
* Customize the login page
* Change few translation strings
* Add a few pages

For more details, see [Portal Extension](http://documentation-devel.engineering.redhat.com/docs/en-US/JBoss_Portal_Platform/6.1/html/Development_Guide/chap-Portal_Extension.html) page of
JBoss Portal Platform Developer Guide.

System Requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this example project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or newer and Maven 3.0 or newer.

The project is designed to be deployed on JBoss Portal Platform 6.1 running on JBoss EAP.

Configure Maven
---------------

You have two options how you can configure Maven: A. Use hosted Maven repository or B. Download & setup zipped Maven repository.

### A. Use hosted Maven repository

This is the easier and thus recommended option. You need to configure the Maven user settings as follows:

* Look for the `settings.xml` file in the `${user.home}/.m2/` directory. For example:

        For Linux or Mac: ~/.m2/settings.xml
        For Windows:       \Users\USER_NAME\.m2\settings.xml or \Documents and Settings\USER_NAME\.m2\settings.xml
* If you have an existing `settings.xml` file, modify it with the configuration information from the `settings-hosted-repo.xml` 
  file located in the root folder of JBoss Portal Platform quickstarts.
* If there is no `settings.xml` file, copy the modified `settings-hosted-repo.xml` file to the `.m2` directory for your 
  operating system and rename it to `settings.xml`.

### B. Download & setup zipped Maven repositories

1.  Download the following zipped Maven repositories from [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/), 
    Downloads > JBoss Enterprise Middleware:
    * JBoss Portal Platform 6.1 Maven Repository 
    * Web Framework Kit 2.1.0 Maven Repository
    * Web Framework Kit 2.0.0 Maven Repository
    * Application Platform 6.1.1 Maven Repository
    * Application Platform 6.0.0 Maven Repository
    
    Unpack each of these files to a separate directory.

2.  Modify the `settings-zipped-repos.xml` file located in the root directory of JBoss Portal Platform 
    quickstarts:
    * For each zipped repository unpacked in the previous step, replace `/path/to/repo/` within `file:///path/to/repo/...`
      with the fully qualified path of the directory where you unpacked the given zipped Maven repository in the previous 
      step.
    * Note that path to each repository needs tobe set twice: one within `<repository>` tag and one within
      `<pluginRepository>` tag.
    * Be sure to use 3 forward slashes after `file:`. Two slashes are there for the protocol and one for the fully qualified 
      path. For example:

            file:///home/joedoe/Quickstarts/jpp-6.0-quickstarts
3.  Configure the Maven user settings.
    * Look for the `settings.xml` file in the `${user.home}/.m2/` directory. For example:

            For Linux or Mac: ~/.m2/settings.xml
            For Windows:       \Users\USER_NAME\.m2\settings.xml or \Documents and Settings\USER_NAME\.m2\settings.xml
    * If you have an existing `settings.xml` file, modify it with the configuration information from the `example-settings.xml` 
      file.
    * If there is no `settings.xml` file, copy the modified `example-settings.xml` file to the `.m2` directory for your 
      operating system and rename it to `settings.xml`.

Build and Deploy
----------------

Portal Extensions and Portal Containers are not hot-deployable. Therefore, it is not possible to deploy them using 
`mvn jboss-as:deploy` or copying to the default JBoss EAP deployment folder when 
JBoss Portal Platform is running. Instead of that you will need to:

1. Make sure that the Portal is not running, e.g. by running 

        $JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect controller=127.0.0.1:9999 command=:shutdown

2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Run the following command to build the archive:

        mvn clean package

    This will create `ear/target/gatein-portal-extension.ear`.
4. Copy this file into the JBoss Portal Platform extension deployment folder: `$JBOSS_HOME/gatein/extensions`

Access the Extension
--------------------

To ensure that the Portal Extension has been deployed successfully, visit the the base URL of your Portal. Which is
[http://127.0.0.1:8080/portal](http://127.0.0.1:8080/portal/) in the most common case.

You should see some differences compared to the original Portal.


<!--~ Included from gatein-portal-quickstarts-parent/src/main/freemarker/include/start-the-portal.md.ftl ~-->
Start the Portal
----------------

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the web profile:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

To delete a Portal Extension or Portal Container:

1. Delete `JBOSS_HOME/gatein/extensions/gatein-portal-extension.ear`
2. Restart JBoss Portal Platform

Please note that the content written to the database by the Extension or Portal Container (such as adding new pages) is not 
reversible.


Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run this Quickstart
------------------------------------------------------------

Portal Extensions and Portal Containers are not directly deployable from JBoss Developer Studio nor Eclipse at this time. 
See Build and Deploy section above for an alternative.

Debug the Application
---------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following 
commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

    mvn dependency:sources
    mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
